### Why did I make it?
As I use hyprland user, I really needed a quick way to switch between windows without having using the keyboard shortcuts So ,I designed the Hackpad(hack)

### What was the hardest part about this ?
I had tons of issues with making the Firmware, as I'm on arch linux too I got too many errors. but at the last I figured out everything.
